Role:
    Provides a reusable, imperative logging utility for the Stylometrics project. Centralizes logging logic for LLM calls,
    feature extraction, and training routines. Ensures consistent log formatting, tag handling, and file management across modules.

Design Goals:
    - Enable all modules to log LLM responses, errors, and process steps with consistent tags (e.g., RESPONSE, NEXT RESPONSE, ERROR, INFO).
    - Support append and context-managed logging to arbitrary files.
    - Allow flexible tagging and message formatting for traceability.
    - Facilitate future expansion (e.g., log rotation, verbosity levels).

Architectural Constraints:
    - All logging logic must be callable as Python functions or context managers.
    - No subprocess or shell command execution is allowed in this module.
    - All interface and behavioral assumptions are documented in ApiNotes.
    - File size monitored; suggest splitting if exceeding 1/3 context window.

Happy-Path:
    1. Import log_message or LogContext from logging_utils in any module.
    2. Use log_message(tag, message, log_file) for simple logging.
    3. Use LogContext(log_file_path) as a context manager for multi-step logging.
