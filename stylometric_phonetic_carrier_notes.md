## Abstract

This paper introduces a novel phonetic-harmonic stylometric carrier for steganographic encoding in textual data. Leveraging phonetic resonance—such as vowel harmony, rhythmic cadence, and phoneme overlap—we demonstrate encoding of binary data through subtle manipulations of sentence pairs...

*Includes layering of counterfactual grammar, persona weighting, phoneme rhythm, and cultural dissonance as stylometric fingerprinting and covert signaling strategies.*

## Structural Anomaly Expansion

This carrier system is extended using:

- **Reflexive Loop Embedding**: e.g., “I realized I had already done this”
- **Tense Conflict Carriers**: e.g., switching from “was” to “is” mid-discourse
- **Comma Splice Patterns**: encoded by incorrect clause linking
- **Temporal Nonlinearity**: narrative transitions encoding logical disorder
- **Spelling Noise Vectoring**: repeat-letter signals in onomatopoeia
- **Narrative Perspective Shift**: embedding bitstrings in POV transitions

These are parsed into a stylometric substrate for durable covert watermarking.

## Experiments

- LLM survivability testing using `t5-v1_1-xl`
- Ollama-based local inference validation
- Decoder accuracy for grammatical counterfactuals: >90% in preliminary trials
- Visualized phoneme resonance distributions
- Future work includes GPT-4 self-repair loop breakage detection

---

## Prototype Design

Stylometric carrier modules:

- `phonetic.py` – harmonic analysis
- `counterfactual.py` – grammar disruption encoder
- `persona.py` – idiom/dialect embedding
- `resonance_graph.py` – cadence and recurrence mapping
