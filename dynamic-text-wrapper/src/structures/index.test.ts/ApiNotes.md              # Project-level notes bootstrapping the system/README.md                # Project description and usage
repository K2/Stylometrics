# ApiNotes for index.test.ts

This file serves as the documentation for the tests defined in `index.test.ts` located in the `src/structures` directory. It outlines the purpose, design considerations, and expected behavior of the tests related to the structure definitions used in the dynamic text wrapping project.

## Purpose
The tests in `index.test.ts` are designed to validate the correctness and integrity of the types and interfaces that define various text structures, including:
- Sentence
- Paragraph
- Section
- Chapter
- Volume

## Design Goals
- Ensure that the defined structures behave as expected when instantiated and manipulated.
- Validate that the types correctly enforce the intended constraints and relationships among different text structures.
- Provide a comprehensive suite of tests that cover various scenarios for each structure type.

## Constraints
- The tests must adhere to TypeScript's type-checking rules to ensure that the defined structures are correctly implemented.
- Any changes to the structure definitions should be accompanied by corresponding updates to the tests to maintain consistency.

## Expected Behavior
- Each test case should clearly define the input and the expected output.
- The tests should cover edge cases, such as empty structures and maximum length constraints.
- Assertions should be made to verify that the structures behave as intended under various conditions.

By maintaining this documentation, future developers can understand the rationale behind the tests and the expected behavior of the text structures, facilitating easier maintenance and updates to the codebase.
