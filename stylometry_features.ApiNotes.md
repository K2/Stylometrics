# Stylometry Features Module API Notes

## Purpose
This module provides functions to extract stylometric features from text content, enabling quantitative analysis of writing style.

## Key Components
- `extractStylometricFeatures`: Main function that processes text and returns numerical metrics
  - Input: Text string
  - Output: Record of feature names to numerical values
  - Features include lexical, syntactic, and structural characteristics

## Design Goals
- Extract features that are useful for authorship attribution
- Provide consistent, normalized metrics regardless of text length
- Support fingerprinting with stable feature extraction
- Balance precision with performance for reasonable-sized texts

## Constraints
- Depends on the compromise NLP library for text processing
- Feature extraction should be deterministic for the same input text
- Each feature value should be normalized to account for varying text lengths

## Integration Points
- Used by StylometricFingerprinter for generating and verifying fingerprints
- Can be used independently for stylometric analysis

## Future Improvements
- Add language-specific feature extraction
- Optimize for performance with longer texts
- Add more sophisticated readability and complexity metrics
