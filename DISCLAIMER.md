# DISCLAIMER

## Experimental Status

The K2-Sonnet Stylometrics project is currently in an **experimental stage** of development. The steganographic techniques implemented in this repository, including zero-width character encoding, stylometric pattern encoding, and structural encoding, are research prototypes and have not been comprehensively tested against all potential detection or removal methods.

## No Warranty

THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND ANY EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS, CONTRIBUTORS, OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THIS SOFTWARE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

## Known Limitations

1. **Detection Resistance**: While the multi-layered approach provides significant resilience, the steganographic techniques may be detectable through specialized analysis methods. No guarantees are made about the undetectability of embedded data.

2. **Transformation Resilience**: Although designed to survive various content transformations, the degree of resilience varies by transformation type and intensity. Complete metadata persistence cannot be guaranteed across all possible transformation scenarios.

3. **Capacity Limitations**: Each encoding method has different capacity constraints. Users should not assume unlimited data embedding capabilities.

4. **Security Considerations**: The cryptographic implementation has not undergone formal security audit. Do not use for high-security applications without independent review.

## Use At Your Own Risk

By using this software, you acknowledge and accept:

1. That you understand its experimental nature
2. That you will conduct your own testing appropriate to your use case
3. That you assume all risks associated with its implementation in your systems
4. That you will comply with all applicable laws and regulations related to steganography, privacy, and data protection
5. That the authors and contributors are not responsible for any consequences resulting from the use or misuse of this technology

## Legal and Ethical Considerations

Users are responsible for ensuring their use of this technology complies with all relevant laws, regulations, and ethical standards. The steganographic techniques provided by this project may be subject to legal restrictions in some jurisdictions or applications. Users should seek appropriate legal counsel before implementing these techniques in production environments.
