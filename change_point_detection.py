Change Point Detection for Author Changes in Text Timelines

This module implements the Stylometric Change Point Agreement (StyloCPA) methodology
described in "Stylometric Detection of AI-Generated Text in Twitter Timelines" 
by Kumarage et al. (2023).

The StyloCPA methodology identifies if and when an author change occurs in a text timeline
by detecting change points in stylometric feature time series and measuring agreement
between these change points.
