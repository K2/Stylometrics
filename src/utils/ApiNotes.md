# Error Correction Module for Stylometric Systems

## Design Philosophy

The error correction module provides a generic approach to add resilience to stylometric features,
particularly in environments where data might be perturbed (through intentional or unintentional means).
The module emphasizes:

1. **Gray code encoding** - Where adjacent values differ by only one bit, making the system robust against 
   small perturbations in feature values
   
2. **Redundancy** - Adding controlled redundancy to allow recovery from data loss or corruption

3. **Modularity** - Designed to work with any existing stylometric feature extraction system

4. **Composability** - Can be easily integrated into any data processing pipeline

## Key Components

- `ErrorCorrection` - Core implementation of error correction algorithms
- `ErrorCorrectionAdapter` - Adapter for various data types used in stylometric analysis
- `ErrorCorrectedStylometric` - Application-specific wrapper for stylometric features

## Use Cases

1. **Robust Feature Extraction**
   - Apply error correction to n-gram frequencies, sentence patterns, or other numerical features
   - Makes stylometric analysis more resilient to noise and minor text changes

2. **Counterfactual Embedding Protection**
   - Enhances counterfactual embeddings with error correction capabilities
   - Provides higher likelihood of successful recovery even when some embedded signals are lost

3. **Authorship Attribution**
   - When extracting stylometric signatures for authorship, error correction provides
     tolerance against minor editing or formatting changes

4. **Watermarking**
   - When embedding authorship watermarks in text, error correction ensures recoverability
     even after text modification

## Integration Points

The error correction module can be applied at various stages in the stylometric pipeline:

- **Feature Extraction** - Apply to raw features after initial extraction
- **Feature Transformation** - Apply during dimensionality reduction or normalization
- **Embedding** - Apply when embedding data into text
- **Authentication** - Apply during feature matching/comparison

## Implementation Notes

- Gray code implementation is optimized for performance with larger data sets
- Redundancy levels are configurable based on expected noise levels
- The system handles both binary data and floating-point feature vectors
- Error detection capabilities can identify when data has been tampered with beyond recovery
