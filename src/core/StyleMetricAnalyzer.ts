/**
 * @ApiNotes Stylometric Analysis System
 * 
 * Design Goals:
 * - Implement a matrix-based representation of various stylometric feature capacities
 * - Support weighted averaging of original content through strategic sampling
 * - Account for higher-order degrees of stylistic features
 * - Incorporate temporal versioning awareness for content evolution
 * - Leverage structural metadata (chapters, forwards, notes) for enhanced analysis
 * 
 * Key Interactions:
 * - Matrix operations for feature capacity calculations
 * - Sampling subsystem for content analysis
 * - Metadata extraction and processing pipeline
 * - Version control integration for temporal analysis
 * 
 * Known Constraints:
 * - Computational complexity of higher-order feature analysis
 * - Memory requirements for large matrix operations
 * - Accuracy limitations in sampling-based approaches
 * 
 * Dependencies:
 * - Matrix computation library
 * - Text sampling and analysis framework
 * - Metadata extraction utilities
 * - Version control integration module
 * 
 * Implementation Notes:
 * - Consider parity/erasure coding techniques for robust feature extraction
 * - Implement sliding window analysis for temporal feature evolution
 * - Support partial feature extraction from incomplete data
